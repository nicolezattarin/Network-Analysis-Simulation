# Network Analysis and Simulation

This project is a collection of tools for network analysis and simulation, based on the course [Network Analysis and Simulation](https://didattica.unipd.it/off/2020/LM/IN/IN2371/002PD/INP9087850/N0).

The first part of the course is focus on providing basic statistical and analytical tools for simulation, while the second part is focused on the simulation of network by means of ns3. 

## Overview 
### Mathematical and analytical tools:
1. Statistical analysis: in [statistical_analysis](https://github.com/nicolezattarin/Network-Analysis-Simulation/tree/main/theoretical_tools/statistical_analysis) we explore the use of basic tools (e.g. confidence intervals, correlations, data visualization), testing both a data samples from a uniform and a normal distribution;

An example of analysis follows. Consider a sequence of 1000 data, each of which is composed by 48 elements uniformly distributed in [0, 1]. The following figure shows CI and corresponding sample mean, computed on of 48 items, compared with the true mean, represented by the 1000 datasets of 48 elements. The vertical dashed line vertical dashed line represents the real mean, and it shows how many times it falls into the computed CI.

2. Random number generators: in [RNG](https://github.com/nicolezattarin/Network-Analysis-Simulation/tree/main/theoretical_tools/RNG) we p√®rovide a class for the generation of random numbers (uniform, exponential, geometric, binomial, poisson) and we explore the use and limitations of these generators;
