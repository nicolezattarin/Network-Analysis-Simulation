# Network Analysis and Simulation

This project is a collection of tools for network analysis and simulation, based on the course [Network Analysis and Simulation](https://didattica.unipd.it/off/2020/LM/IN/IN2371/002PD/INP9087850/N0).

The first part of the course is focus on providing basic statistical and analytical tools for simulation, while the second part is focused on the simulation of network by means of ns3. 

## Overview 
### Mathematical and analytical tools:
1. Statistical analysis: in []
Using the data provided on moodle, reproduce Figures 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 (no need to draw the boxes, just the values), 2.7, 2.8, 2.10 (skip ( b))
Using MATLAB’s random number generator, run the following experiment:
a. Generate n=48 iid U(0,1) r.v.’s
b. Find sample mean, sample std dev and 95%-confidence interval for the mean
c. Repeat the experiment independently for 1000 times, and find how many times the confidence interval does not contain the true value of the mean; plot the results ordering the intervals by increasing lower extreme of the CI; comment
(difficult)Prove that, for n U(0,1) r.v.’s, we have
Using MATLAB’s random number generator, run the following experiment
a. Generate n iid U(0,1) r.v.’s, and compute sample mean and sample variance
b. Study the accuracy of the estimate with respect to the true value vs. n
c. Find confidence intervals for the variance vs. n
d. Find 95% prediction interval using theory and using bootstrap
